**Fake News Detector**

The Fake News Detector project aims to develop a machine learning-based system to classify news articles as either fake or real. This project uses Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models to classify news articles based on features extracted from the text.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and consists of news articles with their respective labels (real or fake). The dataset includes text data that was preprocessed to remove unnecessary noise, and features were extracted for model training.

Dataset separated in two files:
1. Fake.csv (23502 fake news article)
2. True.csv (21417 true news article)

Dataset columns:
Title: title of news article
Text: body text of news article
Subject: subject of news article
Date: publish date of news article
